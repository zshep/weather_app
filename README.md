# weather_app

In the weather I use the Open Weather API to get information about a city chosen by a user. I use the fetch() method to grab the cooridnates of a city and then use the coordinates  to grab weather information such as weather temp, the current weather condition, the uv, the humidity and windspeed. It also will show the next five day forcast for the area searched. 



Everytime there is a a search, a history of searches is created and saved into the local storage where it can be pulled later.
